h1. base62

h2. What

The base62 gem monkeypatches Integer and String. It creates an Integer#base62_encode instance method to encode integers into a string with this set of characters: 0-9 + A-Z + a-z. It also creates a String#base62_decode method to reverse the encoded string back into an integer.

I created this gem library to be the basis of a URL minifying product and service that I'll release and host soon.

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install base62</pre>

h2. The basics

<pre syntax="ruby">puts 123456789.base62_encode # => "8M0kX"
puts "8M0kX".base62_decode # => 123456789</pre>

h2. How to submit patches

Read the "8 steps for fixing other people's code":http://drnicwilliams.com/2007/06/01/8-steps-for-fixing-other-peoples-code/. It's good, but doesn't have instructions for GitHub, so come back here after you're done and read on.

If you want to submit patches (or check out the code to see how to change from base 10 to base 62) the project code is on GitHub. Here are good instructions for submitting patches through GitHub: "http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications":http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications
